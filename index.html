    <h1>Welcome to the Website!</h1>
    <h2>A little bit of myself</h2>
    <p>I have always been interested in computers when I was young and I wanted to learn more about it.
       One thing that I would like to learn more about is programming.
       Programming has always been intriguing to me at a young age and I've always wanted understand what each piece of code does.
       <em>I've realized now that I'm not very good at it</em> haha, <strong>but I'm always willing to try and understand it to the best of my abilities.</strong>
       I hope that everyone who's beginning to learn programming, it takes a lot of time to learn and a lot of times where you'll be staring at your screen just confused at what you're look at,
       but you'll learn how to do it eventually.
       Well, thats a little bit of myself. Thank you for reading and I hope you have a great day!
