    <h2>A little bit of myself</h2>
    <img src="../images/itsme.jpg" alt="itsme" class="img"> 
    <p class="text">I have always been interested in computers when I was young and I wanted to learn more about it.
        One thing that I would like to learn more about is programming.
        Programming has always been intriguing to me at a young age and I've always wanted understand what each piece of code does.
        <em class='em'>I've realized now that I'm not very good at it</em> haha, <strong class='strong'>but I'm always willing to try and understand it to the best of my abilities.</strong>
        I hope to everyone who are beginning to learn programming,
        it takes a ton of time to learn and there'll be times where you'll be staring at your screen just confused at what you're looking at,
        but you'll learn how to do it eventually.
        That's a little bit about myself. Thank you for reading and I hope you have a great day!</p>
